### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Will. I like to play games and desparately try to automate myself away from ever having to do the same thing multiple times. Thankfully there is inevitably more things to automate, and more games to play so I'm very rarely bored. You can learn more about me on my site https://willweaver.dev.
